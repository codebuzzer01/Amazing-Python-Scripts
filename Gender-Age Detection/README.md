# GENDER-AGE DETECTION

## DESCRIPTION

The objective of this project is to identify the gender and approximate age of a person(s) present while camera of device is turned on.

## PROJECT REQUISITES

To build this project we will use-

- Deep Learning to accurately identify the gender and age of a person from a single image of a face.
- We will use this [dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/ttungl/adience-benchmark-gender-and-age-classification)
- The predicted gender may be one of ‘Male’ and ‘Female’, and the predicted age may be one of the following 8 ranges- (0 – 2), (3 – 6), (7 – 12), (13 – 20), (21 – 32), (33 – 43), (44 – 53), (54 – 100).

## PROJECT STRUCTURE

These are the steps to build Gender-Age Detection python project-

- Detect faces
- Classify into Male/Female
- Classify into one of the 8 age ranges
- Put the results on the image and display it
